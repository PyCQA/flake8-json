Flake8-JSON
===========

This is a plugin for Flake8 that will format the output as JSON. By default,
the output is **not** pretty-printed. We would love to add that as a separate
formatter option, though.

CodeClimate support is also offered through this plugin as of v20.12.0


Installation

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install flake8-json


Usage
